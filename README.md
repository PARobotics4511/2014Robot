2014Robot
=========

This the code for the Providence Academy FIRST Robotics 2014 robot (whose name is CIMeon). This robot had the functionality of picking up and catching (to a limited extent) exercise ball and consequently launch it. The code is all in C++ despite the erroneous identification of being in D. This code must be compiled and deployed using WindRiver as provided by FIRST.
